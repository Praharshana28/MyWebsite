E-Commerce Webpage – Students Club

Project Overview:
This project is a simple static web page designed using HTML and CSS. It represents an E-Commerce-style layout under the theme “Students Club.” The page displays multiple student categories in a structured card format. It demonstrates the use of Flexbox for layout, CSS hover animations, and a clean page design with a header and footer.

Smooth hover animations with scaling and rotation effects

Image and text combination for each category

Project Structure:
The project contains a single HTML file (index.html) and an image (std.jpg) used for the cards.

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for webpage structure

CSS3 for styling, layout, and transitions

How to Run the Project:

Download or copy all project files into one folder.

Make sure the image file (std.jpg) is placed in the same directory as the HTML file.

Open the index.html file using any web browser to view the webpage.
